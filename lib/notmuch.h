 *
 * NOTMUCH_STATUS_OUT_OF_MEMORY: Out of memory
 *
 * XXX: We don't really want to expose this lame XAPIAN_EXCEPTION
 * value. Instead we should map to things like DATABASE_LOCKED or
 * whatever.
 *
 * NOTMUCH_STATUS_READ_ONLY_DATABASE: An attempt was made to write to
 *	a database opened in read-only mode.
 *
 * NOTMUCH_STATUS_XAPIAN_EXCEPTION: A Xapian exception occurred
 *
 * NOTMUCH_STATUS_FILE_ERROR: An error occurred trying to read or
 *	write to a file (this could be file not found, permission
 *	denied, etc.)
 *
 * NOTMUCH_STATUS_FILE_NOT_EMAIL: A file was presented that doesn't
 *	appear to be an email message.
 *
 * NOTMUCH_STATUS_DUPLICATE_MESSAGE_ID: A file contains a message ID
 *	that is identical to a message already in the database.
 *
 * NOTMUCH_STATUS_NULL_POINTER: The user erroneously passed a NULL
 *	pointer to a notmuch function.
 *
 * NOTMUCH_STATUS_TAG_TOO_LONG: A tag value is too long (exceeds

 *
