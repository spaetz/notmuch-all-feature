  "Major mode for viewing a thread with notmuch.

This buffer contains the results of the \"notmuch show\" command
for displaying a single thread of email from your email archives.

By default, various components of email messages, (citations,
signatures, already-read messages), are hidden. You can make
these parts visible by clicking with the mouse button or by
pressing RET after positioning the cursor on a hidden part, (for
which \\[notmuch-show-next-button] and \\[notmuch-show-previous-button] are helpful).

Reading the thread sequentially is well-supported by pressing
\\[notmuch-show-advance-and-archive]. This will
scroll the current message (if necessary), advance to the next
message, or advance to the next thread (if already on the last
message of a thread).

Other commands are available to read or manipulate the thread more
selectively, (such as '\\[notmuch-show-next-message]' and '\\[notmuch-show-previous-message]' to advance to messages without
removing any tags, and '\\[notmuch-show-archive-thread]' to archive an entire thread without
scrolling through with \\[notmuch-show-advance-and-archive]).

You can add or remove arbitary tags from the current message with
'\\[notmuch-show-add-tag]' or '\\[notmuch-show-remove-tag]'.
